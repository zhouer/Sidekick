"""Provides the foundational `BaseComponent` class for all Sidekick visual components.

This component defines the common blueprint and core functionalities shared by all
the visual elements you create with Sidekick (like `Grid`, `Console`, `Canvas`, etc.).
Think of it as the engine under the hood that handles essential tasks necessary
for any Python object representing a component in the Sidekick UI.

Key responsibilities managed by `BaseComponent`:

*   **Unique Identification:** Assigning a unique ID (`target_id`) to each component
    instance, allowing Sidekick to distinguish between different elements (e.g.,
    multiple Grids).
*   **Connection Activation:** Automatically ensuring the connection to the
    Sidekick panel is active (`activate_connection()`) before sending any commands.
    This happens when you first create a component instance.
*   **Command Sending:** Providing internal helper methods (`_send_command`,
    `_send_update`) for constructing and sending standardized instruction messages
    (like "create this grid", "update that cell", "remove this console") over the
    WebSocket connection according to the Sidekick protocol.
*   **Removal:** Offering a standard `remove()` method to destroy the visual element
    in the Sidekick UI and clean up associated resources in the Python library.
*   **Error Handling:** Providing a way (`on_error()`) for users to register a
    callback function to handle potential error messages sent back *from* the
    Sidekick UI related to a specific component instance.
*   **Message Routing:** Registering each instance with the connection manager so
    that incoming events (like clicks) or errors from the UI can be routed back
    to the correct Python object's internal handler (`_internal_message_handler`).

Note:
    You will typically **not** use `BaseComponent` directly in your scripts. Instead,
    you'll instantiate its subclasses like `sidekick.Grid`, `sidekick.Console`, etc.
    This base class transparently handles the common low-level details for you.

class BaseComponent:
    """Base class for all Sidekick component interface classes (e.g., Grid, Console).

    This abstract class manages the fundamental setup, unique identification,
    and communication logic required for any Python object that represents and
    controls a visual component within the Sidekick UI panel.

    It ensures that when a component instance is created, the connection to Sidekick
    is established, a unique ID is assigned, and the instance is registered to
    receive relevant messages (events, errors) from the UI. It provides standardized
    methods for sending commands (`spawn`, `update`, `remove`) and handling cleanup.

    Note:
        This class is designed for internal use by the library developers when
        creating new Sidekick component types. Users of the library should interact
        with the concrete subclasses (`sidekick.Grid`, `sidekick.Console`, etc.).

    Attributes:
        component_type (str): A string identifying the type of Sidekick component this
            class represents (e.g., "grid", "console"). This must match the type
            expected by the Sidekick UI component and defined in the communication
            protocol.
        target_id (str): The unique identifier assigned to this specific component
            instance. This ID is crucial for routing commands from Python to the
            correct UI element and for routing events/errors back from that UI
            element to this Python object.

        """Initializes the base component, setting up ID, connection, and registration.

        This constructor is called automatically by the `__init__` method of
        subclasses (like `Grid`, `Console`). It performs the essential setup steps:

        1.  **Activates Connection:** Calls `connection.activate_connection()`. This is
            a **blocking call** the *first* time any component is created in a script.
            It ensures the WebSocket connection is established and the Sidekick UI
            is ready before proceeding. Raises `SidekickConnectionError` on failure.
        2.  **Assigns ID:** Determines the unique `target_id` for this instance, either
            using the provided `instance_id` or generating one automatically if `spawn`
            is True and `instance_id` is None.
        3.  **Registers Handler:** Registers this instance's `_internal_message_handler`
            method with the `connection` component, allowing it to receive messages
            specifically targeted at this instance's `target_id`.
        4.  **Spawns UI Element (Optional):** If `spawn` is True, sends the initial
            'spawn' command to the Sidekick UI via the WebSocket, instructing it
            to create the corresponding visual element (using the provided `payload`
            for initial configuration).

        Args:
            component_type (str): The internal type name of the component (e.g., "grid",
                "console", "viz"). This must match the type expected by the
                Sidekick UI and defined in the communication protocol.
            instance_id (Optional[str]): A specific ID for this component instance.
                If `spawn` is True (default), this is optional; if None, a unique ID
                (e.g., "grid-1") is generated automatically. Providing an ID when
                spawning allows deterministic referencing but requires user management
                of uniqueness. If `spawn` is False (attaching to an existing UI
                element), this ID is **required** and must exactly match the ID of
                the pre-existing element in the Sidekick UI panel.
            spawn (bool): If True (the default), a "spawn" command is sent to
                Sidekick immediately after connection readiness to create the
                corresponding UI element using the `payload`. If False, the library
                assumes the UI element with the given `instance_id` already exists,
                and this Python object will simply "attach" to it to send subsequent
                commands (`update`, `remove`) or receive events/errors. The `payload`
                is ignored when `spawn` is False.
            payload (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]): A dictionary containing the initial
                configuration data needed by the Sidekick UI to correctly create
                (spawn) the visual element (e.g., grid dimensions, console settings,
                canvas size). This is **only** used if `spawn` is True. Keys within
                this dictionary should generally conform to the `camelCase` convention
                required by the Sidekick communication protocol. Defaults to None.

        references to user-provided callback functions (e.g., `_click_callback`,
        `_input_text_callback`). The override should simply set these specific
        callback attributes back to `None` to break potential reference cycles and
        ensure they are not called after removal.

        Example override in a hypothetical `Button` subclass:
            ```python
            def _reset_specific_callbacks(self):
                self._click_callback = None
                self._hover_callback = None # If it had a hover callback too
            ```
        """
        # Base implementation does nothing. Subclasses provide the actual logic.
        pass

    def __del__(self):
        """Attempt to unregister the message handler upon garbage collection. (Fallback).

        This special method is called by Python's garbage collector when the
        `BaseComponent` instance is about to be destroyed if its reference count
        reaches zero. It attempts to unregister the instance's message handler
        from the `connection` component as a fallback safety measure in case the
        `remove()` method was not called explicitly.

        Warning:
            Relying on `__del__` for crucial cleanup like this is **strongly
            discouraged** in Python. The timing of garbage collection and `__del__`
            execution is unpredictable and not guaranteed, especially during
            interpreter shutdown. **You should always explicitly call the `remove()`
            method** on your Sidekick component instances when you are finished with
            them to ensure proper cleanup in both the Python library and the
            Sidekick UI panel. This `__del__` method is only a best-effort fallback.
        """
        try:
            # Check if the connection component and its function still exist,
            # as they might be garbage collected themselves during interpreter shutdown.
            if hasattr(connection, 'unregister_message_handler'):
                 connection.unregister_message_handler(self.target_id)
                 # Log only at debug level as this is fallback behavior.
