"""Custom application-level exceptions for the Sidekick Python library.

This module defines specific error types that users of the Sidekick library
might encounter, particularly those related to establishing and maintaining
a connection to the Sidekick service (which includes the UI panel and its
communication layer).

These exceptions provide more context than generic Python errors and can help
users understand and potentially handle different failure scenarios when
interacting with Sidekick. They may wrap or be triggered by lower-level
exceptions from the `sidekick.core` package.

    This usually means the Sidekick WebSocket server (typically run by the
    VS Code extension) wasn't running or couldn't be reached at the
    configured URL (e.g., "ws://localhost:5163" by default), or the
    underlying connection attempt was actively refused.

    Common Causes:
    1.  The Sidekick panel isn't open and active in VS Code.
    2.  The Sidekick VS Code extension isn't running correctly or has
        encountered an error starting its server.
    3.  The WebSocket server couldn't start (e.g., the port is already in use).
        Check VS Code's "Sidekick Server" output channel for details.
    4.  A firewall is blocking the connection.
    5.  An incorrect URL was configured via `sidekick.set_url()`.

        url (Optional[str]): The WebSocket URL that the connection attempt was made to, if available.

    A common scenario for this error is when the connection to the Sidekick
    server (WebSocket) succeeds, but the Sidekick UI panel itself doesn't
    respond by announcing its readiness (e.g., via a "system/announce" message)
    within an expected timeframe.

    Common Causes:
    1.  The Sidekick panel is open in VS Code, but its web content (HTML/JS)
        hasn't finished loading or initializing (e.g., due to slow system
        performance or an internal UI error).
    2.  An error within the Sidekick UI panel's JavaScript code is preventing
        it from signaling readiness. Check the Webview Developer Tools in VS Code
        (Command Palette -> "Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools") for errors.

    This indicates that communication was previously working, but the connection
    broke unexpectedly. This can happen if you try to send a command or if the
    background communication layer detects the disconnection.

    Common Causes:
    1.  The Sidekick panel was closed in VS Code while your script was running.
    2.  The Sidekick VS Code extension crashed, was disabled, or VS Code itself was closed.
    3.  A network interruption occurred (less common for local connections).
