"""Pyodide-specific implementation of the TaskManager.

This TaskManager leverages the existing asyncio event loop provided by the
Pyodide environment (typically running in a Web Worker). It does not create
a new thread or manage the loop's lifecycle directly, as that is handled
by the browser and Pyodide runtime.

This class acts as a lightweight adapter to the externally-managed event loop,
conforming to the `TaskManager` interface.
