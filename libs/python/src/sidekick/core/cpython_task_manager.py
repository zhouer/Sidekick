"""CPython-specific implementation of the TaskManager.

This module provides `CPythonTaskManager`, a concrete implementation of the
`TaskManager` abstract base class. It is designed for standard CPython
environments where asyncio operations need to be managed alongside potentially
synchronous application code.

The `CPythonTaskManager` achieves this by running an asyncio event loop in a
separate daemon thread. This allows the main application thread to remain
synchronous (e.g., blocking on user input or waiting for the service to stop)
while asynchronous tasks (like network communication or timed events) are handled
concurrently by the event loop in its dedicated thread.
