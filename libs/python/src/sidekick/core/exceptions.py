"""Core exceptions for the Sidekick library's underlying infrastructure.

This module defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions that are used by the
core components of the Sidekick library, such as the TaskManager and
CommunicationManager.

These exceptions are intended to be relatively generic and focused on the
fundamental operations of these core components. Higher-level, application-specific
Sidekick exceptions (e.g., those related to UI interactions or specific
Sidekick features) may inherit from or wrap these core exceptions.
