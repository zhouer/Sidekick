"""Defines the abstract base class for managing low-level communication channels.

This module provides the `CommunicationManager` Abstract Base Class (ABC).
Concrete implementations of this class will handle the specifics of different
communication transports, such as WebSockets (for CPython environments) or
JavaScript `postMessage` (for Pyodide environments).

The `CommunicationManager` is responsible for:
- Establishing and tearing down the raw communication link (e.g., WebSocket connection).
- Sending raw string-based messages over the established link.
- Receiving raw string-based messages from the link.
- Reporting changes in the connection status (using `CoreConnectionStatus`).
- Notifying about underlying communication errors that might occur.
- Allowing higher-level services (like `ConnectionService`) to provide callback
  functions during connection to handle incoming messages, status changes, and errors.

This abstraction allows the rest of the Sidekick system to interact with different
communication methods through a consistent interface.
