"""Manages the WebSocket connection between your Python script and the Sidekick UI.

This module acts as the central communication hub for the Sidekick library. It
handles the technical details of establishing and maintaining a real-time
connection with the Sidekick panel running in Visual Studio Code.

Key Responsibilities:

*   **Connecting:** Automatically attempts to connect to the Sidekick server
    (usually running within the VS Code extension) the first time your script
    tries to interact with a Sidekick module (e.g., when you create `sidekick.Grid()`).
*   **Blocking Connection:** It **pauses** (blocks) your script during the initial
    connection phase until it confirms that both the server is reached and the
    Sidekick UI panel is loaded and ready to receive commands. This ensures your
    commands don't get lost.
*   **Sending Commands:** Provides the mechanism (`send_message`, used internally
    by modules like Grid, Console) to send instructions (like "set color", "print text")
    to the Sidekick UI.
*   **Receiving Events:** Runs a background thread (`_listen_for_messages`) to listen
    for messages coming *from* the Sidekick UI (like button clicks or text input)
    and routes them to the correct handler function in your script (e.g., the
    function you provided to `grid.on_click`).
*   **Error Handling:** Raises specific `SidekickConnectionError` exceptions if it
    cannot connect, if the UI doesn't respond, or if the connection is lost later.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Handles clean shutdown procedures, ensuring resources
    are released when your script finishes or when `sidekick.shutdown()` is called.

Note:
    You typically interact with this module indirectly through functions like
    `sidekick.run_forever()` or `sidekick.shutdown()`, or simply by using the
    visual module classes (`Grid`, `Console`, etc.). However, understanding its
    role helps explain the library's behavior, especially regarding connection
    and event handling. The library does **not** automatically attempt to reconnect
    if the connection is lost after being established.

    Common Causes:

    1. The Sidekick panel isn't open and active in VS Code.
    2. The Sidekick VS Code extension isn't running correctly or has encountered an error.

    (the web content inside the panel) to finish loading and send back a signal
    confirming it's ready to receive commands. If this signal doesn't arrive
    within the timeout period, this error is raised.

    Common Causes:

    1. The Sidekick panel is open in VS Code, but it hasn't finished loading its
       HTML/JavaScript content yet (e.g., due to slow system performance or
       network issues if loading remote resources, though usually local).
    2. There's an error within the Sidekick UI panel's JavaScript code preventing
       it from initializing correctly. Check the Webview Developer Tools in VS Code

    This indicates that communication was working previously, but the connection

    Common Causes:

    1. The Sidekick panel was closed in VS Code while your script was still running.

def run_forever():
    """Keeps your Python script running indefinitely to handle Sidekick UI events.

    If your script needs to react to interactions in the Sidekick panel (like
    button clicks, grid cell clicks, console input, etc.), it needs to stay
    alive to listen for those events. Calling `sidekick.run_forever()` at the
    end of your script achieves this.

    It essentially pauses the main thread of your script in a loop, while the
    background listener thread (managed internally) continues to receive messages
    from Sidekick and trigger your registered callback functions (e.g., the
    functions passed to `grid.on_click()` or `console.on_input_text()`).

    How to Stop `run_forever()`:

    1. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where your script is running.
    2. Call `sidekick.shutdown()` from within one of your callback functions
       (e.g., have a "Quit" button call `sidekick.shutdown` in its `on_click` handler).
    3. If the connection to Sidekick breaks unexpectedly, `run_forever()` will
       also stop (typically after a `SidekickDisconnectedError` is raised).

    Raises:
        SidekickConnectionError (or subclass): If the initial connection to Sidekick
            cannot be established when `run_forever` starts. The script won't enter
            the waiting loop if it can't connect first.

    Example:
        >>> import sidekick
        >>> console = sidekick.Console(show_input=True)
        >>> def handle_input(text):
        ...     if text.lower() == 'quit':
        ...         console.print("Exiting...")
        ...         sidekick.shutdown() # Stop run_forever from callback
        ...     else:
        ...         console.print(f"You typed: {text}")
        >>> console.on_input_text(handle_input)
        >>> console.print("Enter text or type 'quit' to exit.")
        >>>

# Python interpreter exits normally (e.g., script finishes, sys.exit()).
# This ensures a best-effort attempt to close the WebSocket, stop the listener,
# and send cleanup messages like 'offline' or 'clearAll'.
