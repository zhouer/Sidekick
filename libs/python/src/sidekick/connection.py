"""Handles the Sidekick service connection and provides module-level API functions.

This module acts as the primary public-facing API for Python scripts to interact with
the Sidekick service. It manages a singleton instance of the `ConnectionService`
(from `sidekick.connection_service`) which orchestrates the actual communication
and lifecycle management.

The public functions exposed here (`set_url`, `activate_connection`, `shutdown`,
`run_forever`, etc.) are wrappers that delegate their operations to the
singleton `ConnectionService` instance. This design pattern simplifies the
user-facing API while centralizing complex connection logic, making the library
easier to use.
