"""Sidekick Python Library (`sidekick-py`).

Welcome to the Sidekick Python library! This is your starting point for
connecting your Python code to the Sidekick visual coding buddy, which typically
runs inside the Visual Studio Code editor.

Sidekick helps you **see your code come alive**. Instead of just imagining what
loops are doing or how data structures change, you can use this library to create
visual representations and interactive elements directly within the Sidekick panel
in VS Code.

What can you do with it?
    *   Create interactive grids for maps, games, or data display (`sidekick.Grid`).
    *   Show text output like `print()`, but in a dedicated Sidekick area, and
        even get text input back from the user (`sidekick.Console`).
    *   Visualize your variables (lists, dictionaries, objects) and see how they
        change over time, automatically (`sidekick.Viz` with `sidekick.ObservableValue`).
    *   Draw shapes, lines, and text on a 2D canvas (`sidekick.Canvas`).
    *   Add clickable buttons and text input fields to trigger actions in your
        Python script (`sidekick.Control`).

These visual components update in real-time as your Python code executes, making it
easier to understand, debug, and demonstrate programming concepts.

Getting Started:
    1.  **Install:** Make sure you have `sidekick-py` installed (`pip install sidekick-py`)
        and the Sidekick VS Code extension is installed and enabled.
    2.  **Open Panel:** In VS Code, open the Sidekick panel (Ctrl+Shift+P, search for
        `Sidekick: Show Panel`).
    3.  **Import:** Start your Python script with `import sidekick`.
    4.  **Create:** Instantiate a visual component, e.g., `grid = sidekick.Grid(5, 5)`.
        The connection to Sidekick happens automatically here!
    5.  **Interact:** Use the component's methods, e.g., `grid.set_color(0, 0, 'blue')`.
    6.  **Listen (if needed):** If you need to react to user clicks or input
        (using methods like `grid.on_click(...)`), you must keep your script
        running. Add `sidekick.run_forever()` at the end of your script. You can
        stop it by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

Happy visual coding!

import logging

# --- Version ---
# Import the version number defined in _version.py so users can access it.
from ._version import __version__

# --- Logging Setup ---
# Set up the main logger for the 'sidekick' library.
# This allows users of the library to easily control the log output level
# (e.g., show detailed debug messages) by configuring this logger in their script.
logger = logging.getLogger("sidekick")

# Add a default NullHandler if no handlers are already configured by the user.
# This prevents the common "No handlers could be found for logger 'sidekick'"
# warning if the user's script doesn't explicitly configure logging.
# Log messages will simply be discarded unless the user adds their own handlers
# (e.g., via logging.basicConfig()).
if not logger.hasHandlers():
    logger.addHandler(logging.NullHandler())

# --- Core connection/configuration/lifecycle functions ---
# These functions manage the underlying communication channel to the Sidekick UI
# and allow for basic configuration and script lifecycle control.
from .connection import (
    set_url,                          # Set the server URL (call before connecting).
    # close_connection is mostly internal, prefer shutdown()

    shutdown,                         # Cleanly disconnects from Sidekick.

from .errors import (

    SidekickDisconnectedError,        # Raised if the connection is lost *after* being established.

# or specific classes (`from sidekick import Grid, Console`), but this list
# controls the behavior of wildcard imports.
