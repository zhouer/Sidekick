"""Provides the foundational `Component` class for all Sidekick visual components.

This module defines the `Component` class, which serves as the base for all
visual elements in the Sidekick library (e.g., `Grid`, `Button`, `Canvas`).
It encapsulates common functionalities required for any Python object that
represents and interacts with a corresponding UI element in the Sidekick panel.

Key responsibilities managed by `Component`:

*   **Unique Identification:** Each component instance is assigned a unique
    `instance_id`. This ID is crucial for the Sidekick system to distinguish
    between different UI elements, especially when multiple components of the
    same type exist.
*   **Command Sending:** Components send commands (like "spawn" to create the UI
    element, or "update" to modify its state) to the Sidekick UI. This is done
    through internal helper methods that format messages according to the Sidekick
    protocol and delegate the sending to the central `ConnectionService`.
    The sending of the initial "spawn" command is non-blocking; the command is
    queued if the connection to the Sidekick service is not yet active.
*   **Parenting and Layout:** Components can be nested within layout containers
    (like `Row` or `Column`). The `parent` attribute, specified during
    initialization, determines where the component appears in the UI hierarchy.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Components have a `remove()` method to instruct the
    Sidekick UI to destroy the visual element and to clean up associated
    resources on the Python side.
*   **Error Handling:** Users can register an `on_error` callback to be notified if
    the Sidekick UI reports an error related to a specific component instance.
    These errors are delivered as structured `ErrorEvent` objects.
*   **Event Message Routing:** Each component instance registers itself with the
    `ConnectionService`. When the UI sends back events (e.g., a button click)
    or error messages, the `ConnectionService` routes these messages to the
    `_internal_message_handler` of the correct Python `Component` object.

Note:
    While `Component` is fundamental, users of the Sidekick library will typically
    not instantiate `Component` directly. Instead, they will create instances of
    its more specialized subclasses like `sidekick.Grid`, `sidekick.Console`, etc.

    incoming messages (events or errors) from the UI back to the component.

    Attributes:
        component_type (str): A string identifying the type of Sidekick component
            (e.g., "grid", "button"), as defined in the communication protocol.
        instance_id (str): The unique identifier for this component instance.

        """Initializes the base component and sends a "spawn" command to the UI.

        This constructor is called by subclasses (e.g., `Grid()`, `Button()`).
        It performs several critical setup steps:

        1.  **ID Assignment:** A unique `instance_id` is determined.
        2.  **Handler Registration:** Registers an internal message handler with the
            `ConnectionService` for this component's `instance_id`.
        3.  **Payload Preparation:** Assembles initial configuration and parent
            information into a "spawn" message payload.
        4.  **Spawn Command Scheduling:** Sends a "spawn" command to the Sidekick UI
            via the `ConnectionService`. This operation is **non-blocking**.
            The command is queued if the Sidekick service is not yet active.
            The implicit activation of the `ConnectionService` (if this is the
            first component) is also non-blocking.
        5.  **Error Callback Registration:** Registers the `on_error` callback if provided.

        Args:
            component_type (str): The internal type name of the component,
                matching the `component` field in the Sidekick protocol
                (e.g., "grid", "button").
            payload (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]): A dictionary containing initial
                configuration data specific to the component type. This data is
                sent to the UI as part of the "spawn" command.
            instance_id (Optional[str]): An optional, user-defined unique
                identifier for this component. If `None`, an ID will be
                auto-generated. If provided, it must be unique across all
                Sidekick components in the current session.
            parent (Optional[Union['Component', str]]): The parent container
                component (e.g., a `sidekick.Row` or `sidekick.Column` instance)
                or its string `instance_id`. This determines where the new
                component is placed in the UI layout. If `None`, the component
                is added to the default top-level area of the Sidekick panel.
            on_error (Optional[Callable[[ErrorEvent], Union[None, Coroutine[Any, Any, None]]]]):
                An optional callback function. If the Sidekick UI sends an error
                message related to this component, this function will be called
                with an `ErrorEvent` object. The callback can be a regular
                function or a coroutine function (`async def`).

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the provided `instance_id` is invalid (e.g., empty)
                        or if the `ConnectionService` detects a duplicate `instance_id`.

                       callable function.
            SidekickDisconnectedError: If `send_message` is called (internally by `_send_command`)

        Warning:
            It is **strongly recommended** to explicitly call the

            Relying on `__del__` for cleanup in Python has several caveats:
            -   The timing of `__del__` execution is not guaranteed and can be unpredictable.
            -   `__del__` might not be called at all if the object is part of a reference cycle
                that the garbage collector cannot break.
            -   Errors raised within `__del__` are often ignored and can be difficult to debug.
            -   During interpreter shutdown, the state of modules and global variables
                (like those in `sidekick_connection_module`) can be unreliable.

            This `__del__` method provides a **best-effort** attempt to unregister the
            component's message handler from the `ConnectionService` if `remove()`
            was not explicitly called. This is a defensive measure to reduce potential
