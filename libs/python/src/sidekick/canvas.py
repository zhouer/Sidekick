"""Provides the Canvas class for creating a 2D drawing surface in Sidekick.

Use the `sidekick.Canvas` class to create a blank rectangular area within the
Sidekick panel where your Python script can draw simple graphics. This allows
you to visually represent geometric concepts, create algorithm visualizations,
build simple game graphics, or even produce basic animations controlled by your code.

Key Features:

*   **Drawing Primitives:** Draw basic shapes like lines (`draw_line`),
    rectangles (`draw_rect`), circles (`draw_circle`), polygons (`draw_polygon`),
    ellipses (`draw_ellipse`), and text (`draw_text`).
*   **Styling:** Control the appearance with options for fill color (`fill_color`),
    line color (`line_color`), line width (`line_width`), and text size/color.
*   **Coordinate System:** The origin (0, 0) is at the **top-left corner**.
    The x-axis increases to the right, and the y-axis increases downwards.
    All units (coordinates, dimensions, radii) are in pixels.
*   **Double Buffering:** Create smooth, flicker-free animations using the
    `canvas.buffer()` context manager. This draws a complete frame off-screen
    before displaying it all at once.
*   **Interactivity:** Make your canvas respond to user clicks using the
    `on_click()` method to register a callback function.

Basic Usage:
    >>> import sidekick
    >>> # Create a 300 pixel wide, 200 pixel tall canvas
    >>> canvas = sidekick.Canvas(300, 200)
    >>>
    >>> # Draw a red diagonal line across the canvas
    >>> canvas.draw_line(10, 10, 290, 190, line_color='red')
    >>>
    >>> # Draw a blue filled rectangle with a thick border
    >>> canvas.draw_rect(50, 50, 100, 80, fill_color='blue', line_width=3)
    >>>
    >>> # Draw some text
    >>> canvas.draw_text(150, 120, "Hello Canvas!", text_color='white', text_size=16)

Animation Example (using double buffering):
    >>> import sidekick, time, math
    >>> canvas = sidekick.Canvas(200, 150)
    >>> angle = 0
    >>> for _ in range(60): # Animate briefly
    ...     # --- Draw onto a hidden buffer ---
    ...     with canvas.buffer() as buf: # 'buf' lets you draw on the hidden buffer
    ...         x = 100 + 80 * math.cos(angle)
    ...         y = 75 + 50 * math.sin(angle)
    ...         buf.draw_circle(int(x), int(y), 10, fill_color='orange')
    ...         buf.draw_text(10, 10, f"Angle: {angle:.1f}")
    ...     # --- Display the hidden buffer ---
    ...     # When the 'with' block ends, the hidden buffer's content is shown.
    ...     angle += 0.1
    ...     time.sleep(0.05)
    ...
    >>> print("Animation finished.")
    >>> # Use sidekick.run_forever() if you also need click handling.

        When the user clicks anywhere on this canvas's visible area in the

        executed within your running Python script.

        Note:
            Click events are only triggered by interactions with the main, visible
            (onscreen) canvas (buffer ID 0). Clicks are not detected on hidden

                when a click occurs. This function must accept two integer arguments:

    # onto a non-existent buffer).

    # --- Buffer Management Methods ---
    def buffer(self) -> ContextManager[_CanvasBufferProxy]:
        """Provides a context manager (`with` statement) for efficient double buffering.

        Using this method enables double buffering, the standard technique for
        creating smooth, flicker-free animations or complex drawing sequences.
        Instead of drawing directly to the visible screen (which can cause tearing
        or flickering as elements are drawn one by one), you draw everything for
        the next frame onto a hidden (offscreen) buffer. When you're finished
        drawing the frame, the entire content of the hidden buffer is copied to
        the visible screen in one go.

        How it works in practice:

        1.  **Enter `with` block:** `with canvas.buffer() as buf:`
            *   An offscreen buffer is acquired (or created/reused).
            *   This buffer is automatically cleared.
            *   The variable `buf` becomes a proxy object that mirrors the canvas's
                drawing methods (e.g., `buf.draw_line()`).
        2.  **Inside `with` block:**
            *   All drawing commands called on `buf` (e.g., `buf.draw_circle(...)`)
                are sent to the *hidden* offscreen buffer. The visible screen remains
                unchanged during this time.
        3.  **Exit `with` block:**
            *   The visible canvas is automatically cleared.
            *   The *entire* content of the hidden buffer is drawn ("blitted") onto
                the visible canvas in a single, fast operation.
            *   The hidden buffer is released back into an internal pool so it can
                be reused efficiently next time you enter a `buffer()` context.

        Returns:
            ContextManager[_CanvasBufferProxy]: An object designed to be used in a
            `with` statement. The object yielded by the `with` statement (`buf` in
            the example) provides the drawing methods that target the hidden buffer.

        Example (Simple Animation):
            >>> import sidekick, time, math
            >>> canvas = sidekick.Canvas(150, 100)
            >>> x_pos = 10
            >>> for frame in range(50):
            ...     with canvas.buffer() as frame_buffer: # Get the hidden buffer proxy
            ...         # Draw background (optional, buffer starts clear)
            ...         # frame_buffer.draw_rect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height, fill_color='lightblue')
            ...         # Draw moving element on the hidden buffer
            ...         frame_buffer.draw_circle(x_pos, 50, 10, fill_color='red')
            ...         frame_buffer.draw_text(5, 15, f"Frame: {frame}")
            ...     # --- Screen automatically updates here when 'with' block ends ---
            ...     x_pos += 2 # Move for next frame
            ...     time.sleep(0.03) # Control animation speed

        This performs the necessary cleanup actions:

        1.  **Destroys Offscreen Buffers:** Sends commands to the Sidekick UI to
            destroy any hidden offscreen buffers that were created for this canvas
            instance via `canvas.buffer()`, releasing their resources in the UI.
        2.  **Calls Base `remove()`:** Invokes the `BaseComponent.remove()` method, which:
            a. Unregisters the internal message handler for this canvas.
            b. Resets registered callbacks (`on_click`, `on_error`) to `None`.
            c. Sends the final 'remove' command to the Sidekick UI to delete the
               main canvas element itself.

        After calling `remove()`, you should no longer interact with this `Canvas` object.

        Raises:
            SidekickConnectionError (or subclass): Can occur if sending the
                'destroyBuffer' or the final 'remove' command fails. Cleanup of local
                Python resources (callbacks, handlers, buffer pool state) will still
