"""Stores the version number for the Sidekick Python library.

This module simply defines the `__version__` constant, which contains the
current version string for the `sidekick-py` package. This is used during
package building and allows users to check the installed version like this:

Examples:
    >>> import sidekick
    >>> print(sidekick.__version__)
    0.0.4 # Or the currently installed version
"""

# The single source of truth for the package version.
__version__ = "0.0.4"
